# 💵 Expense Tracker

This is an Expense tracker app that allows you to save income and expenses with the date, amount, and title.

# 🚀 Features

- **Saved Data**: All transactions are saved via Local Storage allowing to persist user's information
- **Filter Transactions**: Comes with a filter feature to only see from a specific date to another date. This filters both transactions and chart information.
- **Expense Chart**: I used a library called **Chart.js** to add a visual representation of expenses vs income.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Website is available for all devices.

## ⚒️ Technologies

- `JavaScript`
- `HTML`
- `CSS`
